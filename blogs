                <p> Frshgrnd takes a different approach from the blogs above. Coffee fanatic, Aaron Frey is on a worldwide hunt for the best coffee. He has explored countries in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and several states in the US.

                  Here, Aaron doesnt just learn about coffee, but the places and cultures where each of them originates from. He also cleverly recommends coffee shops on a nicely displayed world map, along with a grading scale. Aarons goal is to be able to find that best cup of coffee and share it with all of us.</p>
